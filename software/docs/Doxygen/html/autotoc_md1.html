<div class="textblock"><p>Goal of this project is to create a flexible application which allows user to view enviroment variables on a website interface and controll the enviromnet from interface within a small chamber or box with actuating technology based on user's choice.</p>
<p>An agile approach has been taken for developing this application as the first attempt was probably going to be far from good:</p>
<p>Firstly after assessing the initial set of hardware</p>
<p>Once a working sensing prototype has been established for each software release the following process must be carried out:</p><ol type="1">
<li>Have a meeting assessing the state of the project.</li>
<li>Define new feature set and or modifications based on feedback, testing, hardware and bugs.</li>
<li>Append to &amp; Modify the following requirement sections.</li>
</ol>
<p>An Itterative approach.</p>
<p>The base of application must conist of sensors able to obtain the following set of environmental conditions:</p><ul>
<li>Light Intensity - This would be used as a hueristic for controlling light actuator</li>
<li>Temperature</li>
<li>Humidity</li>
<li>Co2 or eCo2</li>
<li>TVOC</li>
</ul>
<p>[-] Ideally each sensor should have an interrupt pin. [x] All sensors should utilize one protocol if possible this should be *I2C/SMBUS.</p>
<p>NOTE: SPI Would be faster, however, extension would be required for RPi which would complicate design.</p>
<p>NOTE: None of the sensors we have decided to use for demo has interrupt functonality.</p>
<p>This class must contain the following virtual functions to be overriden by each sensor class when inherting.</p><ul>
<li>Initialize - Opens the file descriptor to the sensor and does initial writes to sets up the sensor for reading operations.</li>
<li>Reset - Writes to sensor to set up initial state.</li>
<li>Close Device - Calls Reset function and closes the file descriptor</li>
</ul>
<p>The class is going to also following private variables:</p><ul>
<li>m_pI2CDriver - a pointer to I2C driver object.</li>
<li>m_fd - File Descriptor for I2C device.</li>
</ul>
<p>The I2C driver functions must be implemented as signle object, only one instance of the object is going to be initialized and reference to this object is going to be passed in initialization stage of each device that requires access to the driver's functions.</p>
<p>I2C driver must contain contain methods for plain I2C writes as well as SMBUS. The implementation should esentially be a wrapper around the API that linux provides.</p>
<p>The GPIO drivermust be implemented as signle object, only one instance of the object is going to be initialized and reference to this object is going to be passed in initialization stage of each device that requires access to the driver's functions.</p>
<p>The object should be implementing using file descriptors to sys/ and contain the following functions:</p><ul>
<li>- Set up a pin based on</li>
<li>Set GPIO Direction</li>
<li>Set GPIO State</li>
<li>Read GPIO State</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: Currently only relay board object uses the GPIO driver. Therefore methods could've been implemented into relayboard object, this approach wasn't taken as the designed architecutre allows the</p>
<p>User must have freedom to choose the appropriate sensors for the application therefore no specific set of actuating elements must be recommended.</p>
<p>Stated aproach means actuating method must The actuating elements are be</p>
<p>relay is going to be used to allow for user to connect desired actuaiting. 4 Channels is the minimmum and which going to allow for the following:</p><ul>
<li>Lights</li>
<li>Heating Element</li>
<li>Fan</li>
<li>Water Pump / Humidifier (Not Applicable Since High Voltage is not permitted for the assignment)</li>
</ul>
<p>The relay is going to be controlled by GPIO Pins.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>[x]The application must be multi-threaded.</li>
<li>To avoid complexity in terms of concurency and communications:<ol type="a">
<li>[x] All threads must be contained in a single process</li>
<li>[x] Call-backs must be used used where possible.</li>
<li>[x] The Main Threads must idle not execute constantly.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is can be achievied by interrupts, timers and blocking read operations.</p>
<p>Delay may be used <b>only</b> if it is absolotuley required this has been defined as not infulening or delaying any other tasks, otherwise timers are the preffered choice.</p>
<p>Timers are reliable to about 100Hz, any functionality needing higher sampling rates must utilize different approach preferably signals, interrupts and service routines.</p>
<p>Ideally an interrupt service routines is going to write to handle sensor interrupts. If Interrupt architecture cannot be realized then a a sampling is going to be implemented by a timer with an event function for whole I2C Bus. The sampling rate in such case is going to be at least 1Hz but preferablly 4Hz (Average human reaction time).</p>
<p>As soon as the timer fires the timer event function executes. The Timer event is going to do the following:</p><ol type="1">
<li>Gather data from each sensor by turn</li>
<li>Use controller callback function which sends data to server and executes the actuation loop.</li>
</ol>
<p>as well as set of functions to Tx &amp; Rx data to &amp; from web-server.</p>
<p><a class="el" href="classController.html" title="Controller class. ">Controller</a> object must contain the callback function for sampler object to use <a class="el" href="classController.html" title="Controller class. ">Controller</a> is going to contain data structures holding latest environment data from sampler and hueristics passed from the user by the server. <a class="el" href="classController.html" title="Controller class. ">Controller</a> is going to contain relay object(s) and have set of functions to controll them.</p>
<p>jQuery -&gt; flask server -&gt; nginx -&gt; CGI handler -&gt; CPP</p>
<p><a class="el" href="classController.html" title="Controller class. ">Controller</a> thread should: initialize the sampler and controller object, start sampling and go into a while loop which should execute based on an exit flag which is going to be able to controlled from web server. In this while loop thread is going to read data from the server. The Read operation for the server should be blocking and as soon as the messeage has been recieved it is going to be processed by striping the opcode and this opcode with the corresponding value should be passed to the event handler function.</p>
<p>Code must contain doxygen comments which is going to allow online to</p>
<p>Unit Test should focus on the drivers and sensors, this test should run first and compare</p>
<p>For each of the Environment condition sensors should read 10 samples and check each sample</p><ol type="1">
<li>Check the value is within the maxiumum and minimum for the sensor</li>
<li>Check if the value is in reasonable range</li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Relay board testing:</p><ol type="1">
<li>S</li>
</ol>
<p>Integration test should test the main objects responsible for controll in the application:</p><ul>
<li><a class="el" href="classSampler.html" title="Sampler Class. ">Sampler</a></li>
<li><a class="el" href="classController.html" title="Controller class. ">Controller</a></li>
<li>JSONHandler</li>
